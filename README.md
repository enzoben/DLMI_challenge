## Architecture
|aze| aze|

In `data_analysis.ipynb` we perform data analysis and transformation on the training data. Int `data_preparation.ipynb` we construct pre-evaluate dataset to reduce training time. 

## Models 

Checkpoints of our models are stored in `model/` and can be used by following the `Test forward pass` in the `DLMI_main.ipynb` notebook.
